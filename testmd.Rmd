## Data Science Specialization 

* Uses R 
* Nine courses 
* Goes from raw data to data products
```{r}
temp <- data.frame(date = c(1, 2, 3), value = c(22, 2, 33))
temp
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
